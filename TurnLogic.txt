At the beginning of the round, everybody rolls the die, and the turn ranking goes from highest to lowest.

Then, a queue is created with the aliases of the players, retrieved from the getSender() method.
Once the queue is successfully created, 

Peek at the front of the queue and allow that player to play.
Once the player has rolled and moved, dequeue the player and enqueue them at the end of the queue.
Repeat until a player wins.
